Details are small components that display some information about a piece of content, such as a Motion or Argument. They are displayed beneath the Header. If the content is the main piece of the content (i.e. the subject of the "view" page), all details must be visible.

When using a detail, you'll probably want to use wrapper component, such as DetailType or DetailStatus.

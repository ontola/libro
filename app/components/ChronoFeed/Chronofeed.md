The ChronoFeed shows a chronological feed of ChronoItems. These items can be speeches, comments, events or any sort of thing that happens at some time. The component is primarily designed to be used in the Event view, but may be used in other views as well in the future.

    <ChronoFeed>
      <ChronoItem

        endDate={new Date(1475498673892)}

        De griffier staat op en verlaat de zaal
      </ChronoItem>
